# CBZ-patch

CBZ files (Comic Book Archive) are basically just ZIP files with a different file extension,<br> 
and are often used for storing and reading digital comics.<br>
This is a command line utility for converting directories of image files into CBZ files and vice versa.<br>
It also allows for the deletion of the original directories or CBZ files after conversion.<br>

# Usage

To use this utility, run the script in a directory containing subdirectories of image files.<br>
The script will then present a list of options for each subdirectory, allowing you to choose which one to convert.<br>
After choosing a subdirectory, you will be prompted to choose whether to enable CBZ (convert the directory into a CBZ file)
or disable CBZ (extract the CBZ file into a directory). You will then be allowed to delete the original directories or CBZ files after conversion.<br>

# Requirements

This script requires 7-Zip to be installed on the system.<br>
The path to the 7z.exe file must also be specified in the script.<br>

# Disclaimer

Use this script at your own risk. It is recommended to make backups of your image files before using this script.<br>
I'm not responsible for any data loss or unintended consequences of using this script.
